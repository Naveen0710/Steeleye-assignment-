Explain what the simple List component does?
Basically The List component allows you to display a list of pages or links. You can build the list of links by defining a parent page (and displaying its child pages), manually choosing pages, or defining search criteria.In React, Lists can be created in a similar way as we create lists in JavaScript.

What problems / warnings are there with code?
